Contained here are everything a CSA might need to be prepped for an event. We are constantly building the software list and updating all the resources, so something maybe missing. Please feel free to make suggestions, send PRs ask questions, etc.... Thanks!

CSA File Reference - Contains a list of files useful for CSA work, along with version info, OS, URL, location in repo and notes. -- For any licensed software, please follow the URL listed and accept the end user license.

CSA Note - This is a note specifically for contacting a CSA on and off season for help. For regional events a note with specific information for that event will be handed. Those notes will be uploaded as regional events occur. For any teams that want help for a non-regional event or general help, please use the info in csa_note_XXXX.pdf.

CSA Goodie Bag - This is a list of hardware, software, files, tools, etc... that a CSA might need for an event.

All of these lists, documents and files are in a constantly changing state. Please clone this repo and update it often with a pull. We recommend cloning this repo to your CSA Flash Drive, details in the CSA Goodie Bag, and then updating it there as often as possible. We will try to stay as update to date with the sources of the files as possible.

Thanks and looking forward to another great year in FRC!
First MN CSA team
